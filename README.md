# toCharCode
Toy Project in Haskell that Converts a String to Ascii Numerals

I made this as just as a 'my first real program' in Haskell.

I often need to use the Javascript fromCharCode at work, so this is useful for me.

To use it, clone the repository, run ghc --make toCharCode.hs, and then try:

./toCharCode xss

It should return to you:

String.fromCharCode(120,115,115)

You can also link this in your path if you want.
